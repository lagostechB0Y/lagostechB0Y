# 👋 Hi, I’m Lagostechboy

I’m a backend-focused software engineer working at the intersection of **WordPress internals**, **Laravel-based backends**, and **headless architectures**.

I don’t just “build websites” — I design **maintainable systems**, extensible plugins, clean APIs, and product-ready backends that scale beyond MVPs.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

### WordPress (Core · Plugins · Themes)
I work deeply with WordPress beyond page builders and surface-level customization.

- Plugin architecture (actions, filters, custom hooks)
- Custom post types, taxonomies, meta handling
- Secure admin interfaces & workflow systems
- Cron jobs, background tasks, and performance tuning
- REST API & WPGraphQL for headless use cases
- Clean separation of concerns inside plugins
- WordPress coding standards & long-term maintainability

> I treat WordPress as an **application framework**, not just a CMS.

---

### Laravel & Backend Engineering
I use Laravel as my primary backend framework for building robust services and APIs.

- RESTful API design
- Service-layer architecture
- DTO-driven business logic
- Queue jobs, scheduled tasks, and background workers
- Authentication, authorization, and role systems
- Database design, migrations, and performance-aware queries
- Integration with third-party systems and services

> Laravel is where I model **real business logic**, not just controllers and routes.

---

### Headless & System Architecture
I specialize in **decoupled systems** where the frontend and backend evolve independently.

- WordPress as a headless CMS
- Laravel as a central orchestration backend
- API-first thinking (REST / JSON contracts)
- Frontend-agnostic architectures
- Clear data contracts between systems
- Product-minded backend design

> This approach allows teams to move faster without creating technical debt.
